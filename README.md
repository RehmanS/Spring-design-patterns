# Spring Boot Payment Project
This is a demo project built with Spring Boot that demonstrates how to use the Factory and Strategy design patterns to implement a flexible and extensible payment system. The project adheres to the SOLID principles, particularly the Open/Closed Principle, allowing for easy extension with new payment methods without modifying existing code.

### Project Overview
The project supports two types of payment methods:

    Credit Card
    Wired Transfer

Additional payment methods can be easily added in the future.
